    "In this notebook, we implemented and demonstrated Learning from Demonstration (LfD) for robotic control:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We created a `LearningFromDemonstration` class that uses neural networks to learn control policies\n",
    "2. We generated simulated demonstrations for a reaching task\n",
    "3. We trained the model and evaluated its performance\n",
    "4. We visualized the results showing the correlation between predicted and actual actions\n",
    "5. We extended the approach to a more complex pick-and-place task\n",
    "\n",
    "LfD is a powerful approach for teaching robots complex behaviors by demonstration, avoiding the need to manually program complex control policies. The approach works well when good demonstrations are available, but quality of demonstrations directly affects the learned policy."
