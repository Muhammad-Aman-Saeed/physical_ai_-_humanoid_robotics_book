# Book Navigation Guide

## Recommended Reading Path

The "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book is designed to be read sequentially from Chapter 1 to the end for optimal learning, with each chapter building upon previous concepts. Here is the recommended chronological reading order:

### Part I: Foundations of Physical AI
1. [Introduction to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics](../intro.md)
2. [Mathematical Foundations for Robotics](./fundamentals/math-fundamentals.md)
3. [Sensors and Perception in Physical Systems](./fundamentals/sensors-perception.md)

### Part II: Kinematics and Dynamics
4. [Forward Kinematics](./kinematics/forward-kinematics.md)
5. [Inverse Kinematics](./kinematics/inverse-kinematics.md)
6. [Gait Planning and Locomotion](./locomotion/gait-planning.md)

### Part III: Control and Learning
7. [Machine Learning for Physical Systems](./learning/ml-for-robotics.md)
8. [Reinforcement Learning in Robotics](./learning/reinforcement-learning.md)

### Part IV: Applications and Integration
9. [Human-Robot Interaction](./interaction/human-robot-interaction.md)
10. [Safety and Ethics in Physical AI](./applications/safety-ethics.md)

## Alternative Reading Paths

### For Researchers
Focus on Chapters 1, 7-10 to understand how modern AI techniques apply to physical systems, with particular emphasis on learning methodologies and ethical considerations.

### For Students
Read the book sequentially from Chapter 1 through Chapter 10 for a comprehensive understanding of Physical AI and humanoid robotics.

### For Engineers
Prioritize Chapters 3, 6, 9, and 10 focusing on perception systems, locomotion, human-robot interaction, and safety implementations.

## Chapter Dependencies

- Chapters 1-3 provide foundational knowledge required for all subsequent chapters
- Chapters 4-6 build upon the mathematical and perception foundations
- Chapters 7-8 require understanding of kinematics and dynamics
- Chapters 9-10 integrate concepts from all previous chapters

## Next Steps After Reading

After completing the book, readers should be able to:
- Implement humanoid robot controllers
- Design perception systems for physical robots
- Apply machine learning to embodied systems
- Address safety and ethical considerations in physical AI

For practical application, readers are encouraged to work through the code examples and exercises available in the `/examples/`, `/exercises/`, and `/notebooks/` directories.
