# Task: Implement continue

## Summary
Continue the implementation process for the AI-Driven Development Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics according to the pre-defined tasks in tasks.md.

## Context
This command continues an implementation process that was previously initiated. It checks the status of checklists, loads implementation context from spec, plan, data-model, and contracts, verifies project setup, parses tasks.md structure, and executes the implementation following the task plan with proper phase execution and validation.

## Implementation Details
- Verified all checklist items in requirements.md (all 18 items completed)
- Loaded implementation context from tasks.md, plan.md, data-model.md, research.md, and quickstart.md
- Validated project setup with proper ignore files
- Confirmed all 59 tasks in tasks.md were marked as completed [X]
- Validated implementation against original specification
- Confirmed implementation follows the technical plan
- Verified all acceptance requirements (AR-001 through AR-010) were satisfied
- Produced comprehensive documentation and code examples

## Result
The AI-Driven Development Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics has been successfully completed. The implementation fully satisfies the original specification and technical plan, with all user stories independently functional and tested. The book covers all planned topics from fundamentals to advanced applications, with executable code examples, interactive notebooks, and comprehensive content organized as planned.
